# Hi I'm Erik, & This Is My Portfolio
I have been learning how to code for about a year now. Although I have a background in Graphic and Web Design, 
the idea of programming is new to me as I specialized in the design aspect of web development. 

I made the switch to become a developer when I realized I enjoy solving problems with logic to express my creativity.
It has been an exciting journey for me and I still enjoy implementing my design skills into the projects I develop.

## My Learning Journey

When I decided to learn how to code past HTML and CSS, I began learning Javascript with TeamTreehouse. This was very beneficial
to me as I started to understand how to build simple apps that allowed for use interactivity. However, my learning journey did 
not see a substancial advancement unitl I signed up for Scrimba's Frontend Developer Career Path. No this is not sponsored (haha). 
I am a hands on learner and I learn by doing which is what I was not really taking into consideration before this point. When I completed
Scrimba's FDCP I began to teach myself to code in more depth by taking on more projects until I felt completlety comfortable with what I practiced.

## My Portfolio

Thanks to this new method of learning I built projects faster than before and was able to put together a portfolio of work that I am proud of.
I will continue to learn for as long as I am a person and will implement it into being a developer. Thank you for reading this little peice of 
info about me and I would love feedback about my work at erikramirezatl@gmail.com or reach out to me on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/erik-ramirez-atl/
